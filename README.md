  ## Description 

  LolStack is a user friendly tool to allow summoners to quickly check how their favorite champions stack up against their competitors. After signing up with an email, password, and summoner name, users will be able to navigate to the summoner page which will display a list of their most played champions and useful information about them.

  ## Technology

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Express, our web framework
* [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - Morgan, an improved logging library that works nicely with Express. Now, all requests to our server get logged out in the console. 
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Mongoose, our ORM
* [express-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jwt) - A small library that checks JWTs for us.
* [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - Small library for generating JWTs. Used instead of passport for visibility and so we don't have a magic library chilling there.
